= Maven example

This example describes how to use `git-link&#58;&#91;&#93;` in a maven build.

//tag::maven-integration[]
== Integration in a maven build

The extension is not published on maven central.
You need to add an additional repository to your pom:

[source,xml]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=mvn-repo,indent=0]
----

Then you need to declare `com.bsiag.asciidoctorj:gh-edit` as a dependency for the `org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-maven-plugin` plugin.
Your `<build>` section could looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=mvn-plugin,indent=0]
----

For a complete example, see: git-link:usage/maven-example/pom.xml[pom.xml]
//end::maven-integration[]
