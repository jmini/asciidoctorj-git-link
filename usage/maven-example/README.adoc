= Maven example

This example describes how to use `git-link&#58;&#91;&#93;` in a maven build.

//tag::maven-integration[]
== Integration in a maven build

The extension is published on maven central.

You need to declare `fr.jmini.asciidoctorj:git-link` as a dependency for the `org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-maven-plugin` plugin.
Your `<build>` section could looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
include::pom.xml[tags=mvn-plugin,indent=0]
----

//end::maven-integration[]
